Every day we wait leaves this country more exposed and puts vulnerable populations of families and children on the border more at risk.\nKirstjen Nielsen\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nWe face a humanitarian and security crisis\nBy Kirstjen Nielsen\nUSA Today\nJanuary 9, 2019\nThere is a humanitarian and security crisis at our southwest border. It is getting worse, and a “status quo” response from Congress — inadequate authorities, insufficient funds and indifference to the chaos — will not cut it.\n…\nWhat we do know is that the smuggling of deadly drugs such as fentanyl — which kills thousands every year — is on the rise.\nWe know that the large number of criminals includes thousands of convicted offenders and nearly 800 gang members caught trying to get across the southern border last year alone.\n…\nWe are also facing a humanitarian catastrophe. For the first time, families and children make up the majority of those entering illegally. Why? Because word has gotten out that our broken legal framework will give them a “free pass” into the United States. This has dramatically changed the migrant flows, and it is a crisis because our system wasn’t built to handle it.\nThe trek has become a nightmare, with more than 30 percent of women reporting sexual assault along the way and 70 percent of all migrants reporting violence.\n…\nThe situation is serious. We hope Congress will get serious, too.\nRead the full op-ed here.",
